DotNet-Labirinth
================

Builds and solves labyrinths.

Primâ€™s Algorithm is used to build the maze and Depth-First Search algorithm is used to find path.
It was written during uni summer holidays and was a first application I was proud to show to my friends. It was very impotent milestone in becoming a professional developer.
